# AI Tool Used

- GitHub Copilot

# Usage

- Used for JavaDoc documentation. Wrote two down manually, and used as example for Copilot to follow.
- Used to generate commit messages, with manual editing where required for brevity.
- Used to create basic assertions for `A-Assertions`.
- Used to check for code quality issues, using the CS2103T website as a guide.
- Used to merge JavaFX Tutorial, with manual coding first done to bridge the gap, and Copilot used to change variable names, function names etc.

# Observations

- Copilot can be very effective at widescale things, as long as given sufficient examples to work on; however without such examples, the format or style of the code may be undesired. Specifying the scope is also important, as without it, the AI may try to edit the whole code base vs just a certain subset of files.
- Without sufficient context, Copilot will miss out on small details, e.g. when writing commits/PRs. Especially when there are large diffs, Copilot will try to summarize all the changes made, but may miss out on small things that are extremely key to the change being made.
- Overall, a lot of time is saved from manually writing code/documentation. A decent amount of issues were also brought up regarding the structure, that I did not know about/would not have noticed.
